# The Trinket Path: NYC Edition

Welcome to **The Trinket Path**, this is an interactive guide to some of New York City's coziest cafés, charming trinket shops, and inspiring art galleries.

Created for fellow explorers and collectors, this project combines my love for hidden gems, stationery stores, and beautiful spaces into one scrapbook-inspired digital experience.

The Trinket Path: NYC Edition was developed as my term project for CS601: Frontend Web Development at Boston University MET College.

## About the Project

The Trinket Path: NYC Edition is a curated guide designed to help users discover unique places throughout New York City.

As someone who enjoys visiting cafés, collecting stationery, and exploring art spaces, I wanted to create a project that combines those interests into one interactive website.

Users can browse through three different paths:

* Cafés
* Trinket Shops
* Galleries

Each destination includes descriptions, location information, images, and external links for further exploration.
